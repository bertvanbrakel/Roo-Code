# Integrations Architecture

The `integrations` directory integrates the Roo Code extension with various VS Code features, enhancing the user experience and providing seamless access to VS Code functionalities.

## Key Components

*   [`diagnostics/`](../src/integrations/diagnostics/): This directory contains the code for integrating with VS Code's diagnostics system, which is used to display errors and warnings in the editor. This allows the extension to provide real-time feedback to the user about potential issues in their code.
    *   **Example:** The `DiagnosticsProvider` class might use the VS Code API to create and display diagnostic messages in the editor.
*   [`editor/`](../src/integrations/editor/): This directory contains the code for integrating with VS Code's editor features, such as code actions and completions. This allows the extension to provide intelligent code suggestions and automate common tasks.
    *   **Example:** The `CodeActionProvider` class might use the VS Code API to register code actions that can be triggered by the user in the editor.
*   [`terminal/`](../src/integrations/terminal/): This directory contains the code for integrating with VS Code's terminal, allowing the extension to interact with the terminal. This enables the extension to execute commands and display the output in the terminal.
    *   **Example:** The `TerminalHandler` class might use the VS Code API to create and manage terminal instances.
*   [`theme/`](../src/integrations/theme/): This directory contains the code for customizing the theme of the extension. This allows the extension to provide a consistent look and feel with the VS Code editor.
    *   **Example:** The `ThemeManager` class might use the VS Code API to set the colors and fonts of the extension's UI elements.
*   [`workspace/`](../src/integrations/workspace/): This directory contains the code for integrating with VS Code's workspace features, such as file watching and project management. This allows the extension to monitor changes in the workspace and react accordingly.
    *   **Example:** The `WorkspaceWatcher` class might use the VS Code API to listen for file creation, deletion, and modification events.

## Relationships

The integration components interact with each other and with the core components to provide a seamless experience for the user. For example:

*   The `diagnostics/` component might use the `core/` components to analyze the code and display errors and warnings in the editor.
*   The `editor/` component might use the `api/` components to interact with the LLMs and provide code suggestions.
*   The `terminal/` component might use the `core/` components to execute commands and display the output in the terminal.
*   The `theme/` component might use the VS Code API to customize the appearance of the extension.
*   The `workspace/` component might use the VS Code API to monitor changes in the workspace and update the extension's state accordingly.
