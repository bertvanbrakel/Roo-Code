# Codebase Analysis Plan

1.  **Create `llm_docs` directory:** Create a directory to store the markdown documentation.
2.  **High-Level Overview:** Create a markdown file (`llm_docs/overview.md`) with a high-level overview of the project, based on the file structure and names.
3.  **Key Architectural Areas:** Identify and document the main architectural areas (e.g., API, core, webview-ui) in separate markdown files within the `llm_docs` directory.
4.  **Important Files:** For each architectural area, identify and document the most important files and their roles.
5.  **Extension Activation:** Analyze `src/extension.ts` to understand how the extension is activated and what components are initialized.
6.  **MCP Integration:** Analyze the `src/services/mcp` directory to understand how Model Context Protocol (MCP) is integrated into the extension.
7.  **Webview UI:** Analyze the `webview-ui` directory to understand the structure and components of the user interface.
8.  **Categories Documentation:** Identify and document categories like 'external APIs' and 'LLMs' in a structured way within the `llm_docs` directory.
9.  **Review and Refine:** Review the generated documentation and identify any missing information or areas that need further clarification.
10. **Final Touches:** Add any final touches to the documentation, such as diagrams or examples.
