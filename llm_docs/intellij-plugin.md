# How to Create an IntelliJ Plugin from the Roo Code Codebase

This document provides detailed instructions on how to create an IntelliJ plugin from the Roo Code codebase. This allows developers familiar with the IntelliJ IDEA IDE to leverage the Roo Code functionality within their preferred environment.

## Prerequisites

*   IntelliJ IDEA IDE: You will need a working installation of IntelliJ IDEA to develop and test the plugin.
*   Basic knowledge of IntelliJ plugin development: Familiarity with the IntelliJ Platform SDK and plugin development concepts is essential.

## Steps

1.  **Create a new IntelliJ plugin project.** Use the IntelliJ IDEA IDE to create a new plugin project. Select "New Project" from the File menu, then select "IntelliJ Platform Plugin" from the project types. This will create a basic plugin project with the necessary files and directories.
2.  **Identify reusable code.** The core logic of the Roo Code extension, such as the code for interacting with the LLMs, the MCP integration, and the core utilities, can be reused in the IntelliJ plugin. This code is located in the `src` directory. Carefully analyze the Roo Code codebase to identify the components that can be adapted for use in the IntelliJ plugin.
3.  **Adapt the VS Code API calls to the IntelliJ API.** The VS Code API calls need to be replaced with the corresponding IntelliJ API calls. This will require significant effort, as the two APIs are very different. You will need to consult the IntelliJ Platform SDK documentation to find the appropriate API calls.
4.  **Implement the UI using the IntelliJ UI framework.** The webview UI needs to be reimplemented using the IntelliJ UI framework. This will also require significant effort, as the two UI frameworks are very different. You will need to use Swing or JavaFX to create the UI. Consider using existing UI components from the IntelliJ Platform SDK to maintain a consistent look and feel.
5.  **Create a `plugin.xml` file.** This file describes the plugin to the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. The `plugin.xml` file should be located in the `src/main/resources/META-INF` directory. This file defines the plugin's ID, name, version, vendor, description, dependencies, extensions, and actions.
6.  **Build and test the plugin.** Use the IntelliJ IDEA IDE to build and test the plugin. Select "Build" from the Build menu, then select "Build Project". To test the plugin, select "Run" from the Run menu, then select "Run". You can also use the "Debug" menu to debug the plugin.

## Reusing Code

The following code can be reused from the Roo Code codebase:

*   **LLM Interaction Code:** The code in the `src/api` directory can be reused to interact with the LLMs. This code handles the communication with the different LLM providers and provides a consistent interface for accessing the LLMs.
*   **MCP Integration Code:** The code in the `src/services/mcp` directory can be reused to integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This code handles the communication with the MCP servers and provides access to the MCP tools and resources.
*   **Core Utilities:** The code in the `src/utils` directory can be reused for various utility functions. These functions provide common functionalities such as file system operations, string manipulation, and data transformations.

## Adapting VS Code API Calls

The following VS Code API calls need to be replaced with the corresponding IntelliJ API calls:

*   `vscode.commands.registerCommand`: Use `com.intellij.openapi.actionSystem.AnAction` to register a new action.
*   `vscode.window.createWebviewPanel`: Use `com.intellij.openapi.ui.SimpleToolWindowPanel` to create a new tool window.
*   `vscode.ExtensionContext`: Use `com.intellij.openapi.components.ApplicationComponent` or `com.intellij.openapi.components.ProjectComponent` to access the plugin's context.

## Implementing the UI

The webview UI needs to be reimplemented using the IntelliJ UI framework. You can use Swing or JavaFX to create the UI. Consider using existing UI components from the IntelliJ Platform SDK to maintain a consistent look and feel.

## plugin.xml

The `plugin.xml` file describes the plugin to the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. Here is an example `plugin.xml` file:

```xml
<idea-plugin>
    <id>com.example.roocode.intellij</id>
    <name>Roo Code IntelliJ Plugin</name>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <vendor email="support@example.com" url="http://www.example.com">Example</vendor>

    <depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>

    <extensions defaultExtensionNs="com.intellij">
        <!-- Add your extensions here -->
    </extensions>

    <actions>
        <!-- Add your actions here -->
    </actions>
</idea-plugin>
```

## Running Roo Code in a Container/Sandbox

To enhance security and isolation, you might consider running the core Roo Code logic (LLM interactions, MCP) within a container or sandbox environment inside the IntelliJ plugin. Here are a few options:

*   **Docker Container:** Package the core logic into a Docker container and use the IntelliJ plugin to communicate with the container via a REST API. This provides strong isolation and allows you to manage dependencies separately.
*   **JVM Sandbox:** Use the Java Security Manager or a similar sandboxing mechanism to restrict the access of the Roo Code logic to system resources. This is a lighter-weight option than Docker, but it may not provide as strong isolation.
*   **GraalVM Native Image:** Compile the core Roo Code logic to a native image using GraalVM. This can improve performance and reduce the memory footprint of the plugin.

Note: Due to the significant differences between the VS Code and IntelliJ plugin architectures, it may not be possible to reuse a large portion of the codebase. However, the core logic and utilities can be reused to reduce the amount of code that needs to be rewritten.
