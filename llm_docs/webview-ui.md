# Webview UI Architecture

The `webview-ui` directory implements the user interface for the Roo Code extension using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Key Components

*   [`src/App.tsx`](../webview-ui/src/App.tsx): This file is the main component for the webview UI and likely renders the main layout and components.
*   [`src/index.tsx`](../webview-ui/src/index.tsx): This file is the entry point for the webview UI and likely initializes the React application.
*   [`src/components/`](../webview-ui/src/components/): This directory contains the reusable components used in the webview UI.
*   [`src/context/`](../webview-ui/src/context/): This directory likely contains the React context providers, which are used to manage the state of the webview UI.
*   [`src/lib/`](../webview-ui/src/lib/): This directory likely contains utility functions and helper classes used in the webview UI.
*   [`src/index.css`](../webview-ui/src/index.css): This file contains the CSS styles for the webview UI, including VSCode CSS variables.

## Technologies

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
*   **Vite:** A build tool that provides fast development and optimized production builds.

## Relationships

The webview UI components likely interact with each other to provide the user interface for the extension. The `App.tsx` component might use the components in `src/components/` to render the different parts of the UI, and the `src/context/` might be used to manage the state of the UI.
