# Documentation Update Plan

This document outlines the plan for updating the documentation in the `llm_docs/` directory.

## Goals

- Ensure that all documents in the `llm_docs/` directory are accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
- Create new documents for any new features or functionalities that are not currently covered.
- Create boomerang tasks for any complex or time-consuming tasks.

## Steps

1.  **Review Existing Documents:**

    - Read each file in the `llm_docs/` directory using the `read_file` tool.
    - For each file, compare its content with the description of the corresponding feature or functionality in the codebase.
    - Identify any discrepancies, outdated information, or missing details.

2.  **Update Existing Documents:**

    - Based on the review, use the `apply_diff` tool to modify the existing files to reflect the current state of the codebase.
    - Ensure that the documentation is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

3.  **Add New Documents (if necessary):**
    - If there are new features or functionalities that are not covered by the existing documentation, create new `.md` files in the `llm_docs/` directory using the `write_to_file` tool.
    - Ensure that these new documents are well-written and provide clear explanations of the new features.

## Boomerang Tasks

- Update the `chat-flow.qmd` file with the updated Mermaid diagram code to reflect the MCP and browser tool interactions.
