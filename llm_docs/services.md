# Services Architecture

The `services` directory provides various services used by the Roo Code extension.

## Key Components

*   [`browser/`](../src/services/browser/): This directory likely contains the code for integrating with a browser, allowing the extension to display web pages or interact with web-based services.
*   [`checkpoints/`](../src/services/checkpoints/): This directory likely contains the code for managing checkpoints, which are used to save and restore the state of the extension.
*   [`glob/`](../src/services/glob/): This directory likely contains the code for performing globbing operations, which are used to find files that match a certain pattern.
*   [`mcp/`](../src/services/mcp/): This directory contains the code for integrating with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which is used to communicate with external tools and services.
*   [`ripgrep/`](../src/services/ripgrep/): This directory likely contains the code for using ripgrep, a fast and efficient search tool.
*   [`telemetry/`](../src/services/telemetry/): This directory likely contains the code for collecting telemetry data, which is used to track the usage of the extension.
*   [`tree-sitter/`](../src/services/tree-sitter/): This directory likely contains the code for using tree-sitter, a parser generator tool.

## Relationships

The service components likely interact with each other and with the core components to provide various functionalities for the extension. For example, the `mcp/` might use the `browser/` to display information from external tools and services, and the `telemetry/` might be used to track the usage of the different services.
