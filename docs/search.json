Select “New Project” from the File menu, then select “IntelliJ Platform Plugin” from the project types. This will create a basic plugin project with the necessary files and directories.\nIdentify reusable code. The core logic of the Roo Code extension, such as the code for interacting with the LLMs, the MCP integration, and the core utilities, can be reused in the IntelliJ plugin. This code is located in the src directory. Carefully analyze the Roo Code codebase to identify the components that can be adapted for use in the IntelliJ plugin.\nAdapt the VS Code API calls to the IntelliJ API. The VS Code API calls need to be replaced with the corresponding IntelliJ API calls. This will require significant effort, as the two APIs are very different. You will need to consult the IntelliJ Platform SDK documentation to find the appropriate API calls.\nImplement the UI using the IntelliJ UI framework. The webview UI needs to be reimplemented using the IntelliJ UI framework. This will also require significant effort, as the two UI frameworks are very different. You will need to use Swing or JavaFX to create the UI. Consider using existing UI components from the IntelliJ Platform SDK to maintain a consistent look and feel.\nCreate a plugin.xml file. This file describes the plugin to the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. The plugin.xml file should be located in the src/main/resources/META-INF directory. This file defines the plugin’s ID, name, version, vendor, description, dependencies, extensions, and actions.\nBuild and test the plugin. Use the IntelliJ IDEA IDE to build and test the plugin. Select “Build” from the Build menu, then select “Build Project”. To test the plugin, select “Run” from the Run menu, then select “Run”. You can also use the “Debug” menu to debug the plugin.",

Here are a few options:\n\nDocker Container: Package the core logic into a Docker container and use the IntelliJ plugin to communicate with the container via a REST API. This provides strong isolation and allows you to manage dependencies separately.\nJVM Sandbox: Use the Java Security Manager or a similar sandboxing mechanism to restrict the access of the Roo Code logic to system resources. This is a lighter-weight option than Docker, but it may not provide as strong isolation.\nGraalVM Native Image: Compile the core Roo Code logic to a native image using GraalVM. This can improve performance and reduce the memory footprint of the plugin.\n\nNote: Due to the significant differences between the VS Code and IntelliJ plugin architectures, it may not be possible to reuse a large portion of the codebase.

However, the core logic, utilities, and React components can be reused to reduce the amount of code that needs to be rewritten.",
